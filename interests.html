            <li> <strong>God of Time and Agriculture</strong> <em>Saturn was the Roman god of time, agriculture, and renewal. He ruled over a mythical Golden Age, a time of peace, prosperity, and abundance where humans lived in harmony with nature.</em> </li>
<li><strong>Symbol of Cycles and Seasons</strong> <em>Saturn’s association with time ties him to the cycles of seasons, harvests, and the passage of life, symbolizing both growth and inevitable change.</em> </li>
<li><strong>Lord of the Rings</strong> <em>In The Lord of the Rings, the One Ring and the Rings of Power are central symbols of control, influence, and cyclical struggle. The rings symbolize binding forces, much like Saturn’s rings encircle the planet, suggesting themes of limitation, fate, and power over time.</em> </li>
